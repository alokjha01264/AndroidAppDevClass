inheritence in kotlin
public class can be inherited
in kotlin we write for public- open class xyz{} (base class or super class)
to inherit - class abc: xyz{} (derived or subclass)
function overriding
made a func in super class but wwe want to change function of that func in sub class we'lll use open keyword in superclass fun
then make a func with same name in subclass
overloading of functions- same name different functions of funcs in same class
homework : Write a program using recursion to  find the factorial of a number
